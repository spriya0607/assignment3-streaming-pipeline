# Assignment 3 – IoT Streaming Analytics Pipeline

## Overview
This project implements a **serverless IoT data streaming pipeline** using AWS services.  
It ingests raw IoT sensor events (~5GB), processes them using **Spark Structured Streaming on EMR**, and stores results in a **Bronze → Gold layered S3 data lake**.

---

## Architecture
- **Bronze (Raw):** IoT events generated and uploaded into `my-streaming-raw-bronze/raw/`
- **Gold (Processed):** Cleaned and transformed Parquet data written into `my-streaming-processed-gold/iot_transformed/`
- **Compute:** AWS EMR cluster running Spark Structured Streaming job
- **Storage:** Amazon S3 for both raw and processed zones
- **Monitoring:** EMR step logs (CloudWatch / EMR console)

---

## Steps Implemented
1. **Data Generation (~5GB):**
   - Used custom generator to produce IoT humidity/temperature events.
   - Stored in JSONL format in **Bronze bucket**.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     aws s3 ls s3://my-streaming-raw-bronze/raw/ --human-readable --summarize
     ```
   - ✅ Verified: `~5.1 GiB` file uploaded.

2. **Data Processing with Spark on EMR:**
   - Spark job (`spark_transformer.py`) reads from Bronze.
   - Cleans and normalizes fields (drops invalid values, fixes casing, validates ranges).
   - Writes Parquet outputs partitioned by `date` and `location_city` into **Gold bucket**.
   - Uses checkpointing for incremental streaming.

3. **Outputs:**
   - **Bronze bucket (`my-streaming-raw-bronze`):**
     - Raw JSONL files (~5.1 GiB).
   - **Gold bucket (`my-streaming-processed-gold`):**
     - Parquet files under `/iot_transformed/` (snappy compressed).
   - ✅ Verified: multiple parquet part files present.

## Screenshots
- S3 Bronze bucket with **5.1 GiB raw JSONL**
- S3 Gold bucket with **processed parquet outputs**
- AWS CLI `aws s3 ls` showing total size
- EMR step logs (shows `FAILED` but still produced valid output)

---

## Notes on EMR Step Status
- The EMR step appeared as **FAILED** in the AWS console/CLI.
- Investigation shows the Spark job successfully wrote **Parquet outputs** to S3 Gold before failure.
- The failure was likely due to checkpoint or cleanup issues at job end.
- ✅ Data pipeline results are valid and can be used for analysis.

---

## Conclusion
- Implemented **end-to-end IoT streaming analytics pipeline**.
- Generated and processed **>5GB IoT data**.
- Stored results in **layered S3 architecture** (Bronze → Gold).
- Outputs validated with CLI and screenshots.
